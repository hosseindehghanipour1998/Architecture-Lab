# Architecture-Lab
Here I Upload the assignments , codes and home works that are given and asked during the semester.


# Home Work 1
Implement the Verilog Code for the following terms :
1. D-flipflop (DFF)

2. 8-bit Shift-right Register (SRR)

3. Testbench for DFF & SRR ( see example on slide 45 )

4. Extra credit work

5. Is it possible turn the "Shift-right Register" to a "Shift-left Register" by a small modification in the D-flipflop?

6. Add another control signal to DFF and 8-bit shift register modules named LOR (left or right) to indicate the shift direction. You can use either "if" or "case" statement.
